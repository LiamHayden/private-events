# Private Events
This Private Events project was designed using the *Ruby on Rails* framework (version 7.0.4) and *Bootstrap 5*. 
It allows a user to create events, RSVP to events and cancel RSVPs, along with being able to edit and delete their created events.
The [Devise](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise) gem was used to create the User model.

# Skills Demonstrated
During this project I have demonstrated my knowledge of Ruby on Rails *active record associations*, *through tables*, *active record queries*, and *Ruby on Rails basics*, such as *validations*, *forms*, *migrations*, *MVC*, etc.
